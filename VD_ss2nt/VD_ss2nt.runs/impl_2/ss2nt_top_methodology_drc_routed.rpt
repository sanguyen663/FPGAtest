LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell uut/counter[0]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) in_reg[0]/CLR, in_reg[1]/CLR, in_reg[2]/CLR, in_reg[3]/CLR, in_reg[4]/CLR, in_reg[5]/CLR, in_reg[6]/CLR, in_reg[7]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
